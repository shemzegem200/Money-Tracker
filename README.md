## Project Overview

The Money Tracker Website is a financial management tool that allows users to:
- Add transactions with details such as name, price, description, and date/time.
- View a list of all recorded transactions.
- Delete transactions when necessary.

The backend of this application is built with **Node.js** and **Express.js** and uses **MongoDB** for data storage. We utilize Docker for containerization of the backend, which is hosted on **Microsoft Azure**. The frontend is built using **React.js** and deployed on **Netlify** for a smooth and responsive user experience.

## API Documentation

The backend API exposes several endpoints to interact with transaction data. Here's a breakdown of the routes:

### 1. **Test Endpoint**
- **Path**: `/api/test`
- **Type**: `GET`
- **Function**: This simple test route returns a JSON object confirming the server is working.
- **Response Example**:
    ```json
    {
      "test": true
    }
    ```

### 2. **Add a Transaction**
- **Path**: `/api/transaction`
- **Type**: `POST`
- **Function**: This route allows users to create a new transaction by providing transaction details (name, price, description, datetime).
- **Request Body**:
    ```json
    {
      "name": "Coffee",
      "price": 5.50,
      "description": "Coffee at cafe",
      "datetime": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
    }
    ```

    }
    ```

### 3. **Get All Transactions**
- **Path**: `/api/transactions`
- **Type**: `GET`
- **Function**: This route retrieves all stored transactions from the database and returns them in a JSON array.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "_id": "some-id-1",
        "name": "Coffee",
        "price": 5.50,
        "description": "Coffee at cafe",
        "datetime": "2025-01-15T10:00:00Z"
      },
      {
        "_id": "some-id-2",
        "name": "Lunch",

## Backend Deployment

The backend is Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability. To deploy the backend to **Azure**:

1. **Dockerize the backend**:
    - Ensure you have a valid `Dockerfile` in the backend directory.
    - Build the Docker image:
      ```bash
      docker build -t money-tracker-backend .
      ```
    - Push the Docker image to **Azure Container Registry** or any container service of your choice.

2. **Deploy to Azure**:
    Use the Azure CLI to push and deploy the containerized backend to Azure:
    ```bash
    az container create --resource-group <your-resource-group> --name money-tracker-backend --image <image-name> --port 3000
    ```

## Frontend Deployment

To deploy the frontend to **Netlify**, follow these steps:

1. **Build the React app**:
    In the `frontend` folder, run:
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

2. **Deploy to Netlify**:
    - Sign up/log in to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
